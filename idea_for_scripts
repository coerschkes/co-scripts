set symlink on ~/ for scripts

give every script an additional alias method printing the desired alias

on startup exec a script overrriding the current alias file located 
in ~/.bash_aliases with aliases returned from every script alias method

after reload(e.g. restarting shell?) the pc comm should print the commands
with alias
